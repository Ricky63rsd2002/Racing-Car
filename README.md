# Racing-Car
In this project, I create a “Racing Car Game” by using the pygame module in Python. It is one of the most efficient libraries for game development using python.

**Introduction:**
Starting with an introductory window providing three options that are, to start ,to instruction & to quit, to the user,
following this, the user will control the movement of the vehicle accordingly and prevent it from crashing.

The main thing about any game development project is images. Under this project, to make it interactive and attractive I  use the following images:
A background image
Grass image
White strip image
Yellow strip image
Car images
Starting city image
